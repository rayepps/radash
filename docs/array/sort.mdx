## Basic usage

Given an array of items return a new array sorted by the property specified in the get function. A third, and optional, argument allows you to get the sort in descending order.

```ts
import { sort } from 'radash'

const fish = [
  {
    name: 'Marlin',
    weight: 105
  },
  {
    name: 'Bass',
    weight: 8
  },
  {
    name: 'Trout',
    weight: 13
  }
]

sort(fish, f => f.weight) // => [bass, trout, marlin]
sort(fish, f => f.weight, true) // => [marlin, trout, bass]
```
