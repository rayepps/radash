title: shake
description: Remove unwanted values from an object
group: Object
---

## Basic usage

A bit like `_.sift` but for (nested) objects. By default, it will return a new object with all the undefined attributes removed. You can pass a second function argument to remove any attributes by a custom condition.

```ts
import { shake } from 'radash'

const ra = {
  mode: 'god',
  greek: false,
  limit: undefined,
  children: {
    own: undefined,
    adopted: ['athena']
  }
}

shake(ra) // => { mode, greek, children: { adopted: ['athena'] } }
shake(ra, a => !a) // => { mode, children: { adopted: ['athena'] } }
```
