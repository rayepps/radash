description: Convert a function to an error-first function

## Basic usage

Error-first callbacks were cool. Using mutable variables to hoist state when doing try/catch was not cool.

The `tryit` function let's you wrap a function to convert it to an error-first function. **Works for both async and sync functions.**

```ts
import { tryit } from 'radash'

const [err, user] = await tryit(api.users.find)(userId)
```

### Currying

You can curry `tryit` if you like.

```ts
import { tryit } from 'radash'

const findUser = tryit(api.users.find)

const [err, user] = await findUser(userId)
```

## Type support

These utility types and functions help handling the result of tryit

### types

```ts
export type Left<E = Error> = [E, undefined]  // errored result
export type Right<T = any> = [undefined, T]   // successfull result
export type Either<E = Error, T = any> = Left<E> | Right<T>  // errored or successfull result
export type Task<E = Error, T = any> = Promise<[E, undefined] | [undefined, Awaited<T>]>  // async Either
```

### support functions
```ts
isLeft(either: Either): boolean // tests if the result was errored
isRight(either: Either): boolean // tests if the result was successfull
left(either: Either): E // extracts the error from an errored operation
right(either: Either): T // extracts the result from a successfull operation
```
