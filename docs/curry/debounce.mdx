## Basic usage

Debounce accepts an options object with `delay`, `leading`, and a source function to call
when invoked. When the returned function is invoked it will only call the source
function after the `delay` milliseconds of time has passed. Calls that don't result
in invoking the source reset the delay, pushing off the next invocation. The `leading`
option decides whether the source function is called on the first invocation of the debounce
function or not.

```ts
import { debounce } from 'radash'

const makeSearchRequest = event => {
  api.movies.search(event.target.value)
}

input.addEventListener(
  'change',
  debounce({ delay: 100, leading = true }, makeSearchRequest)
)
```

## Timing & Leading

A visual of the debounce behavior when `delay` is `100` and `leading` is in different values.
The debounce function returned by `debounce` can be called every millisecond but it will only
call the given callback after `delay` milliseconds have passed. The `leading` option, `false`
by default, will call the source function immediately the first time the debounce function is
invoked when set to `true`.

```sh
                           Time: 0ms - - - - 100ms - - - - 200ms - - - - 300ms - - - - 400ms - - - -
           debounce Invocations: x x x x - - - - - - - - x x x x x x x x x x - - - - - - - - - - - -
    Source Invocations(leading): x - - - - - - - - - x - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - x - - - - -
Source Invocations(not leading): - - - - - - - - - - x - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - x - - - - -
```

### Cancel

The function returned by `debounce` has a `cancel` method that when called will permanently stop the source function from being debounced.

```ts
const debounced = debounce({ delay: 100 }, api.feed.refresh)

// ... sometime later

debounced.cancel()
```

### Flush

The function returned by `debounce` has a `flush` method that when called will directly invoke the source function.

```ts
const debounced = debounce({ delay: 100 }, api.feed.refresh)

// ... sometime later

debounced.flush(event)
```

### isPending

The function returned by `debounce` has a `isPending` method that when called will return if there is any pending invocation the source function.

```ts
const debounced = debounce({ delay: 100 }, api.feed.refresh)

// ... sometime later

debounced.isPending()
```
