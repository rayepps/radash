description: Create a throttled callback function

## Basic usage

Throttle accepts an options object with an `interval` and a source function to call
when invoked. When the returned function is invoked it will only call the source
function if the `interval` milliseconds of time has passed. Otherwise, it will ignore
the invocation. The `leading` option decides whether the source function is called on
the first invocation of the throttle function or not.

```ts
import { throttle } from 'radash'

const onMouseMove = () => {
  rerender()
}

addEventListener(
  'mousemove',
  throttle({ interval: 200, leading = false }, onMouseMove)
)
```

## Timing & Leading

A visual of the throttle behavior when `interval` is `200` and `leading` is in different
values. The throttle function returned by `throttle` can be called every millisecond but
it will only call the given callback after `interval` milliseconds have passed. The `leading`
option, `true` by default, will delay the execution cycle of source function by one interval
as a whole when set to `false`.

```sh
                           Time: 0ms - - - - 200ms - - - - 400ms - - - - 600ms - - - - 800ms - - - -
           Throttle Invocations: x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x - - - - - - - - - - -
    Source Invocations(leading): x - - - - - x - - - - - - x - - - - - - x - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Source Invocations(not leading): - - - - - - x - - - - - - x - - - - - - x - - - - - - x - - - - - -

```

### isThrottled

The function returned by `throttle` has a `isThrottled` method that when called will return
if there is any active throttle.

```ts
const debounced = throttle({ interval: 200 }, onMouseMove)

// ... sometime later

debounced.isThrottled()
```
